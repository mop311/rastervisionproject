#### Final project report
The final project builds on the presentation to provide a written summary of your project, including the progress you achieved since the presentation. It should answer the following questions: 

1. What is the overall aim of the project and what specific Earth Observation is it trying to solve?
2. What were the methods you developed and/or applied?
3. What were your results? 
4. Did the results show that the project aim was realized? Was an Earth Observation limit pushed back (or potentially pushed back)? If this was a group project, how were the results of individual efforts integrated? 
5. What are potential improvements, and any next steps you plan to take? 

The format of your submission should be styled more like a README or extended tutorial on a software repository than a final paper. That means, that most, if not all, of you should write this in Markdown or Rmarkdown document, presenting code and figures that demonstrate your methods and results along with your text. Longer scripts can be provided as separate source files for the relevant language. So please structure the final projects in a folder like this:

```
- project_name
  |- data
  |- docs
  |- scripts
```

The docs folder contains your Markdown/Rmarkdown file (or other document if needed, but please discuss), data contains any accompanying data, and scripts and longer source code that you can link to in your document.  Ultimately, this structure will help us integrate some of the results into this repo, so that next year's class can build on your good work (note: we don't have to do this in all cases, so we will only do this based on mutual agreement). 

In terms of structure, we want to be less texty and more visual. Question 1 should be addressed in ~500 words. Question 2 should be answered using as many words, text, and code snippets as needed to make the method and your steps reproducible (i.e. someone could read and figure out how to get the same results you show). Question 3 is better to answer with figures and tables, and as much text as needed to describe what the figures are showing.  Questions 4 and 5 should together be answered in **no more** than 500-1000 words, depending on how many people are in your group. 

Since this is a methods class, Questions 2 and 3 hold the greatest interest, and here is where the size of the group matters.  More detail is expect in these sections, reflecting the subdivision of work

The format you follow in terms of headings and structure can be flexible as long as the questions above are addressed.  It should be submitted as a single project/report, but each member should write the section that describes their contribution, while writing in any common sections can be divided equitably between team members.
